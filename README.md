=== kModal = Kustom Modal ===
kModal originally came up because we needed a modal that did not copy the div contents requiring us to rebind links. We since have developed it further to support custom styles. It was very important to us that we did not interfere with your modal style desires.

=== How to use kModal ===
Coming soon.
